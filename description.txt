DROP is a single player game using joystick. Manuever your guy up or down through the counter-scroll layers to make it to the bottom of the screen. Only move into holes, or you loose 100. Get bumped up at the edge and loose 200. May be better to escape upwards, if possible, than to get bumped. Drop as far as there is room - sometimes it pays to wait for a long run to appear. Make it to the bottom before the time runs out to win! Win or lose, press fire to play again and again.

The ATR file contains the auto-loading program. Recommend to boot with Altirra.
